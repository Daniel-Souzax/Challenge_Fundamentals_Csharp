# Fundamentals Challenge C#

This repository contains exercises from the C# Course Challenge to practice the fundamentals of C# programming language. Each project folder corresponds to an exercise. Here's a brief description of the functionality of each exercise:

1. **PersonalizedGreeting**
   - A program where the user needs to enter a name, and a personalized welcome message with their name is displayed: "Ol√°, Daniel! Seja muito bem-vindo!".

2. **NameConcatenation**
   - A program that concatenates a first name and a last name entered by the user, and at the end, it displays the full name.

3. **MathOperations**
   - A program where the user enters two double values and returns:
     - The sum of these two numbers;
     - The subtraction between the two numbers;
     - The multiplication between the two numbers;
     - The division between the two numbers;
     - The average of the two numbers.

4. **WordLength**
   - A program where the user enters one or more words, and it displays the number of characters in the inserted word(s).

5. **LicensePlateValidation**
   - A program where the user enters a vehicle plate number, and the program checks if the plate is valid, following the Brazilian standard valid until 2018.For validation, I used the following conditions:
     - The plate must have 7 alphanumeric characters;
     - The first three characters are letters (uppercase or lowercase);
     - The last four characters are numbers.
   At the end, the program displays True if the plate is valid and False otherwise.

6. **DateAndTime**
   - A program that returns to the user the current date displayed in different formats:
     - Full format (day of the week, day of the month, month, year, hour, minutes, seconds).
     - Only the date in the format "29/04/2024".
     - Only the time in 24-hour format.
     - The date with the month spelled out.

I am very happy to complete this first challenge of the C# course from Rocketseat, and I am eager to acquire more knowledge and apply it to future challenges.
